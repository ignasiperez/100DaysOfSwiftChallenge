     - Inside this method (Code D22-02-Method_called_when_user_taps_action_button):
       - Convert the storm image displayed on the detail screen to JPEG format with a compression quality of 80%
       - Create an activity view controller to share content with other apps and services and tell iOS that it should be anchored to the right bar button Item of our navigation item.
3. SHOW A MESSAGE ASKING WHETHER THE USER IS OK WITH THE APP WRITING TO THEIR PHOTO LIBRARY.
   - _`Xcode Info.plist`_
